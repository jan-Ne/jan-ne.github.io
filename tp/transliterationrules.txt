Toki Pona Transliteration Guidelines
General Guidelines
    For transliteration, use the International Phonetic Alphabet with clear syllable boundaries.
    Use the native colloquial pronunciation of the name.
        In the case where there are multiple native terms, use the dominant language. 
        In the case where there are no native terms, use an international form.
    Toki Pona uses one form for names of languages and places where there may be many forms in the native language. 
        It usually uses the adjective form or an unmarked form.
    If possible, it is good to choose a different form or transliteration style of the name to avoid a homonym with a common word.
    Proper names are always capitalized in the Latin script. 
        Capitalization is reserved for proper names to set them apart from common words.

    It is best to establish context using common words before introducing a proper name.
    Adapting a name to Toki Pona makes it accessible to people of various language backgrounds.
    These guidelines make specific choices about how to transliterate certain cases, 
    but you may make different choices based on more language-specific information.
    Names are personal. While many speakers transliterate their own name precisely,
    some may alter it or create a new name.

Phonetic Rules
    Syllables
        In most cases, Toki Pona preserves the syllable count of the original language.
        An /i/ is inserted after postalveolar, palatal, and palatalized consonants at the end of a word.
    Vowels
        High front vowels become /i/.
        High back vowels become /u/.
        Mid front vowels become /e/.
        Mid back vowels become /o/.
        Low vowels become /a/.
    Consonants
        Nasals
            Labial nasals become /m/.
            All other nasals become /n/.
            Nasalization on vowels becomes a coda /n/.
            Any nasals in the coda become /n/.
        Labials
            Labial obstruents, flaps, and trills become /p/ (excluding [v] and [ʍ]).
        Coronals
            Coronal stridents become /s/ (including alveo-palatals).
            Coronal non-stridents become /t/.
            Dental fricatives may become either /s/ or /t/.
                These rules use /s/ for [θ] and /t/ for [ð].
        Dorsals
            Dorsal and pharyngeal obstruents, taps, and trills become /k/ (including palatal occlusives).
        Laryngeals
            Laryngeal consonants are deleted.
        Liquids
            Liquid sonorants become /l/ (excluding [ɹ]).
        Approximants
            Palatal approximants and fricatives become /j/.
            Other approximants become /w/.
            [v] and [ʍ] become /w/.
    Syllabic Consonants
        Syllabic consonants are rewritten with a schwa in the nucleus and the consonant in the coda.
    Schwa
        Word-final schwa becomes [a].
        Word initial unstressed schwa is deleted.
        Schwas assimilate to a preceding non-schwa vowel. If there is no preceding non-schwa vowel, they assimilate to the next non-schwa vowel.
        If there are no other non-schwa vowels to assimilate to the schwa becomes [a].
    Metathesis
        Nasal consonants are shifted to the coda to avoid a cluster.
        If there is already a coda nasal, a coda consonant and an adjacent onset nasal are swapped to preserve the coda consonant.
    Glides and Diphthongs
        High front vowels in a diphthong are reduced to /j/.
        High back vowels in a diphthong are reduced to /w/.
        Clusters with glides in non-initial syllables are expanded, inserting [u] before [w], [i] before [j], or moving the first vowel in an adjacent diphthong before the glide to preserve the diphthong.
        Non-syllabic low vowels are deleted.
        Non-syllabic front vowels become /j/.
        Non-syllabic back vowels become /w/.
        Remaining diphthongs are reduced by deleting the second vowel.
    Consonant Clusters
        Plosives are preserved over approximants in a cluster.
        The last consonant in the cluster is preserved. 
    Codas
        A coda consonant is shifted to the following empty onset in the next syllable.
        A coda consonant in a syllable with an empty onset is shifted to the onset.
        All remaining non-nasal coda consonants are removed.
    Illegal sequences
        [ti] becomes [si]
        [wo] becomes [o]
        [wu] becomes [u]
        [ji] becomes [i]
        [n.m] becomes [.m]
        [m.n] becomes [.n]
    Vowel hiatus
        [w] is inserted before [a] after a non-front vowel.
        [j] is inserted before [a] after a front vowel.
        [w] is inserted before [e] after a back vowel.
        [j] is inserted before [e] after a non-back vowel.
        [w] is inserted before [i] to resolve a vowel hiatus.
        [j] is inserted before [o] to resolve a vowel hiatus.
        [j] is inserted before [u] to resolve a vowel hiatus.
